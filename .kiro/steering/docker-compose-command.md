# Docker Compose Command Standard

Always use `docker compose` (without hyphen) instead of `docker-compose`.

This is the modern Docker Compose V2 command syntax.

## Examples

- `docker compose up -d`
- `docker compose down`
- `docker compose logs`
- `docker compose build`
- `docker compose ps`

Never use the legacy `docker-compose` command.
